        <h2>Project Overview: <br>Buckminster Fuller Institute</h2>
        <h3>This project is an in-depth analysis of the usability of Buckminster Fuller Institute website. In this case study we - Taylor Cole, Shirad Rahim, and me (Uma) - analyzed the usability of the site through a test created and administered through the Loop 11 usability testing site. Each team member recruited users to take the test which consisted of 17 tasks, and 10 questions. Participants were recruited through the snowball method, where participants were asked to share the link after completion of the study. <br><br></h3>
        <p>During the test we asked the users to allow us to record their screens, but enabled them to turn off their microphones while completing the test. Upon test completion we analyzed the data by taking the length of time to complete tasks, percentage of participants who were able to complete the tasks, and pages needed to click through to complete the task and compared them to the 10 questions we asked users at the end of task completion. Through this analysis we were able to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the website, while pinpointing the design principles that needed to be improved or were already satisfactory. </p>

        <h2>Tasks Assigned: 1-10</h2>
        <h3>Task #1 - Surfing the site</h3>
        <p> All users were able to complete this task, and the average time spent surfing the site was 2 minutes and 50 seconds. There was one outlier that surfed the site for 6 minutes total, but that was due to their lack of understanding of the testing process, and where to click on their screen once they completed the task. <br><br>This task was simple and allowed users to get a sense of the website before completing the rest of the test and there was no difficulty involved in clicking through the site.</p>

        <p style="padding-left:20px;"> Principles of Credibility applied to this portion of the taks. This task was meant to set the tone of the website for the users, and through their surfing they were able to evaluate information architecture, the design look and the tone of the content. <br><br>This task was the foundation of the rest of the test and allowed the users to become familiar with the content on the website before starting on other tasks.​</p>

        <h3>Task #2 - Finding the name of the BFI Executive Director</h3>
        <p> Only a little over half of the participants were able to complete this task with almost a 40% failure rate. It took users clicking between 5 and 6 pages before properly completing this task. Those who were able to find the executive director took at least a minute to do so, and those who did not only spent around 30 seconds searching. <br><br>Navigation during this task lacked efficiency, and only those who spent longer on the task, and clicked through multiple pages, were the ones who effectively completed this task.​​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2>Principle of Design for information architecture:</h2>
        <p style="padding-left:20px;">This task was not completed efficiently but was effective when users spent some extra time searching the site. It was not efficient due to cognitive, layout and credibility principles somewhat lacking in the design. More specifically the sites guessability became a problem, requiring users to click through multiple pages, and the site has a somewhat complex information architecture. The layout of the site might not have been as organized as some users would have liked, but was not impossible to navigate.</p>

        <h3>Task #3 - Find the timeline of the Buckminster Fuller’s life</h3>
        <p>  This task was successfully completed by almost 70% of the users, with the average time spent on this task around 30 seconds. Those who successfully completed this task only needed 2-3 page clicks, meaning it was found efficiently and effectively. <br><br>The users that did not complete this task abandoned the task early on, only going to one page, most likely meaning they did not fully understand the task they had to complete​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2> Principles of Design for effective layout:</h2>
        <p style="padding-left:20px;"> This task completion is effective and efficient because it employs the <b>cognitive</b> and layout principles. The information is accessible because it uses proximity and alignment to make the timeline easy for the user to find. It’s also guessable because the information is under one of the main tabs that is consistently displayed on the top toolbar as you navigate through the site.​​</p>

        <h3>Task #4 - Where is the BFI library located?</h3>
        <p> Only two of the users we tested were able to successfully find the location of the BFI library. Between the two users that were successful they each needed at least 5+ page clicks and over a minute of searching to complete the task. <br><br>Those that failed spent time looking at the “About” pages, but failed to realize they had to continue to click through it in order to find the address of the library. <br><br>The completion of this task was not efficient. The only time it was effective was when the users spent an extended amount of time trying to locate the information by clicking across multiple pages. ​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2>Principles of Design for information structure:</h2>
        <p style="padding-left:20px;">There was excessive amounts of white space on the ‘About BFI' page that would have better been served by listing the address, instead of asking the users to click through more pages to find it. This aspect of the site is lacking the proper layout principles because information is not grouped together in a way that makes sense to the user.</p>

        <h3>Task #5 - What is the BFI’s phone number?</h3>
        <p> This task was successfully completed by 100% of the users we tested. <br><br>Previously, during Task #4, the users searched for the location of the BFI library, and many went to this page to find that information. Therefore when this task was carried out every user was able to remember where the BFI number was located. <br><br>This might have taken a bit longer had this task been asked of the users prior to Task #4, but nonetheless it was still easy for them to complete. ​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2>Principles of Design for information structure:</h2>
        <p> The task’s completion had the opposite effect on the users that Task #4 had, even though it was asking for similar information. This could be due to a better layout (it made more sense to the user where this information could be found), but the majority of its efficiency and effectiveness is because of the cognitive principles used by the user, specifically learnability. <br><br>As the users are completing tasks, they are learning how to work the site and remembering where they saw specific information. In this case many of the users had previously been to this webpage, and knew exactly where to find it when asked to complete this task.</p>

        <h3>Task #6 - Find the list of BFI supporters</h3>
        <p>  Only two users were able to complete this task successfully and both had extremely varying levels of efficiency. The first participant took almost a full minute to complete the task, clicking through 8 different pages. The second participant was able to find the information in only 18 seconds and 2 page clicks. <br><br>The rest of the users we tested were unsuccessful and almost all of them spent over 45+ seconds searching. One of our participants even spent 2 minutes searching, clicked through 9 different pages, and was still unsuccessful. <br><br>The most common pages users looked to for this information was the donation and resource pages, assuming they would find information on supporters in these areas of the website. <br><br>As a whole this task was only done efficiently and effectively by one user, and the overwhelming majority found it very difficult or impossible to complete. ​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2>Principles of Design for information architecture:</h2>
        <p> This task lacked efficiency and effectiveness because due to the poor layout of the necessary information. The users expected proximity to the other pages they searched such as donation, and the resource pages, and the BFI supporters being separate from those pages did not intellectual make sense to them. Therefore, this was a very inefficient search for the majority of users, requiring them to click around multiple pages to find the information, or abandon the task completely</p>

        <h3>Task #7 - Find the email address for Volunteering</h3>
        <p> All but one of the users we tested was able to successfully complete this task. <br><br>The majority of users were able to locate the information in 25 seconds or less, only requiring 2-3 page clicks to do so. The user who was unable to complete this task was able to find the “get involved” page, but missed the final step in clicking on the volunteer options, possibly because it is under the “work with us” tab and they equated that with paid opportunities only. <br><br>Overall this task can be completed efficiently and effectively, maybe only requiring an extra step in critical thinking to find exactly what one is looking for.​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2>Principles of Design for information structure:</h2>
        <p> This task was easily completed by majority of the users, and is quite explicit on the website. The “Get Involved” tab employs the cognitive principles of design, meaning that many users know the tab’s meaning and that within it they will find information on volunteer opportunities. The layout also makes sense intellectually, physically and visually because all of the information under this tab connects with one another in some shape or form.</p>

        <p> All but one user was able to quickly and efficiently locate the members of the Board of Directors. <br><br>The user who did not find the correct page did get to the “Who We Are” page that does have a link for the board, so ultimately they were able to find what they were looking for but did not take the extra step to get to the exact webpage. <br><br>Overall this was completed efficiently and effectively by all of the users.​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2>Principles of Design for information structure:</h2>
        <p> This task was completed efficiently and effectively because this aspect of the site uses the layout, credibility and contrast principles of design. The differing grey color makes it easy for the user to locate the Board of Directors, and the image (right) utilizes a large amount of white space making the design appear more credible to the user.</p>

        <p>  All but one user was able to effectively find this page. Each successful user located it in 15 second or less, and required only 2 page clicks to do so. <br><br>The user that was the outlier seemed to not understand the instructions of the task because they only spent 20 seconds searching for the page, and then landed on an unrelated page with differing information before clicking to the next task. <br><br>Overall this was one of the most efficiently and effectively completed tasks when you account for page clicks and timing.​</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" >
        <h2>Principles of Design for content strategy:</h2>
        <p>  This task allowed users to employ cognitive principles through repetition. Now that the user has completed a number of tasks, locating this information has become easier, as they have already clicked through every tab once. The navigation is also explicit because the tab users must click says “Become a Member”, so the task mentions the name of the key word they are looking for, “member”. This task also ties in with layout principles because the location of the information just makes sense to the user intellectually and physically.</p>

The average time that participants spent on this task was 33 seconds with an average “Lostness” of 0.68 on all users’ accounts. The most time spent on this task was 42 seconds by a participant, and the shortest was 16 seconds, but both still failed to complete the task. <br><br>The task was abandoned by all users as they had to click through numerous pages to get to the correct page with the winners.

The task was successfully completed within an average amount of time of 25 seconds, less than a minute. The fastest rate was 16 seconds. <br><br>Successfully completed tasks were accomplished in 2 page clicks.

Participants were able to receive the information appropriately and efficiently as they were able to find contact for BFI.

On the page is very abundant, very close together, of the same font, size and color with not much variation, giving poor ease of readability and difficult to navigate. <br><br>This can cause readers to be frustrated or confused since it is hard to read through so much information that looks so similar with little color or sizing and spacing differentiation.

This would only make sense as information on memberships will be readily available when trying to become a member. More so, the “Become a Member” buttons are usually differently colored from the page they are on, sometimes orange or green which is eye-catching and will help users easily remember where to go when they want to become a member.</p>

        <h3>Task #17 - Find information on fiscal sponsorship</h3>
        <p> This task had a success rate of 40% where successful users were able to complete the task in an average of 32 seconds. Successful participants were able to find the information through utilising the search tab in the upper right hand carner of the page. They were not able to navigate through the website’s tabs to find the information and had to independently search for the information they were needing to complete the tasks. <br><br>The task also had a fail rate of 40%. The most common fail path was to go into the support tab of the BFI website. Participants looked into the donate tab as well to try to find the information but could not find the appropriate information. <br><br>Users that abandoned the task looked in the “Links: subcategory of the “About” tab for Fuller, which is more about the founder and not the organization.​​</p>

        <p style="padding-left:20px;"> This information was pretty hard to navigate to and was not effectively or appropriately placed when building the website for fast navigation. Users more readily utilised the search bar to find the information rather than clicking through the website, meaning that it was hard to find any information without independently searching. <br><br>More so, users looked into the Donate tab, but this was still the wrong location. There is not much information given to help find out about the sponsorship of the organization and not readily available or explicit.</p>

        <h2>Questions Assigned & Evaluated</h2>
        <h3>Question #1 - Overall, using the site was a pleasant experience </h3>
        <p> From looking at the responses from participants, 80% of the users agreed that the site was a pleasant experience. However, 20% of participants did not agree or disagree that the site was a pleasant experience. <br><br>Through our analysis, it is safe to say that the information was a little hard to navigate through initially but most times they were easy to navigate once users had a better understanding of how to use the categories of the banner. Participants had gotten accustomed or grasped the idea of utilizing the categories placed on the banner to navigate to the different sections and points of information they needed.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="column" style="padding-top: 100px;">
        <h2> Principles of Design used for a better experience:</h2>
        <p style="padding-left:20px;"> There are many principles that can be altered to help better the experience of users when they visit the website. First, we would reconsider the design look of the pages. There can be an information overload with very little white space, differentiation in colors of the font as well as sizing and spacing. If there were more colors incorporated and white space between lines where there is a lot of information, it can be less frustrating for the reader to follow and can keep them wanting to read as it is easy on the eyes. <br><br>More so, there should be more feedback when clicking on different sections and categories, there is no symbolism that the website has registered any input, and there is just a sudden change of information viewed on the page. Having a spinning circle or a message appear such as “One Moment Please” can gravely help users to wait as they know their request has been acknowledged by the website and will not have to continuously keep clicking.</p>

        <h3>Question #2 - Overall, the navigation throughout the site was easy to use.</h3>
        <p> Based on the findings, we see that five users out of the completed seven testees believe that the navigation throughout the site is easy. They responded with an ‘agree’ while one user ‘strongly agreed’ and another ‘neither agreed, nor disagreed’. <br><br>According to the analysis we’ve done on the tasks, it is apparent that users had a fair bit of trouble navigating through the site successfully. Several failed to find the correct page for the information that they were looking for. Though there were many successful task completions, navigation can still certainly be improved. <br><br>Seamless and effective navigation is critical for any site - it could perhaps be the most important aspect of a website. While the Buckminster Fuller Institute provides lots of resources and information to its users, layed out effectively, it can still use an improved navigation system.​</p>

        <h2> Principles of Design used for improved navigation:</h2>
        <p style="padding-left:20px;"> Principles of Cognition, Credibility, as well as Layout can be used to improve BFI’s navigation. Information architecture is a huge aspect to seamless navigation through any website. Laying out the important bits of information first and prioritizing based on what the visitors of the site need is a crucial step. <br><br>The BFI site has prioritized its information effectively, however, the information laid out can be made more guessable for its new users (since it is a site for new designers and innovators around the world). The functionality and information has been made easily accessible to its users - this falls under principles of cognition as well as credibility. <br><br>Though explicitness of the site’s content can be made more apparent by including cues for its function and method of operation, perhaps by including more effective click or location feedback. In other words, by letting users know where exactly they are on the site and what options they have available to navigate through. This could also be done using the principles of layout through content proximity and alignment.​​</p>

        <h3>Question #3 - Overall, the amount of information on each page was just enough.</h3>
        <p> Everyone except one user ‘agreed’ with this statement. There was, however, one ‘disagree’ which should not be overlooked. The website has a lot of important and useful content on each page of the site. Users have access to a lot of information and resources no matter what page they are on. According to our research, majority find the content to be just enough. So it shouldn’t be an issue. <br><br>Nonetheless, to see that one user ‘disagreed’ to this statement makes us focus on the solutions to this problem. If perhaps there is a bit too much information on each page, how can this be solved? We know how crucial it is to present large bits of information effectively without overwhelming users who visit a website. BFI has done a remarkable job of presenting its resources and information satisfactorily.​</p>

Though most users found that the information was just enough per page, there can be improvements made. Using the Principles of Layout, the content can be organized more effectively through proper use of alignment and proximity, as well as contrast. <br><br>To make one piece of information on a page more apparent than another, the BFI site has used these principles (like contrast) to separate its content, making it easier for users to understand. By keeping its font, colors, and layout consistent and by effectively organizing their data, the site does a good job of making it understandable for its visitors.​​​</p>

There is a variety of responses to this statement, for good reason. <br><br>Users who felt that they were able to navigate through and complete their tasks efficiently may have felt that the images and aesthetics were helpful. Whereas the others, not so much. If there is such a divide in the responses to this statement, an improvement can certainly be made. <br><br>Aesthetics is a large part of any website.
